<h2>IN THE LANE.</h2>

<p><i>Monday.</i>&mdash;<i>Carmen</i> exceptionally excellent. Miss <span class="smcap">Z&eacute;lie de Lussan</span>,
gifted with a light, pleasant voice, sang admirably. Can't have "<i>Trop
de Z&eacute;lie</i>." Mr. <span class="smcap">Barton M</span>c<span class="smcap">Guckin</span>, as <i>Don Jim-along-Jos&eacute;</i>, did all that
can be done with this weak-minded soldier. No holes to be picked in Mr.
McG.'s performance, though there was a portion of his costume that would
have been the better for the attention of Signor <span class="smcap">Soanso</span>, the Spanish
tailor. Perhaps he is one of the "Renters" of Drury Lane. The strongest
and most novel situation was the entrance of a horse, which, like the
old woman who "lived on nothing but victuals and drink," "wouldn't be
quiet," and nearly gave poor <i>Carmen</i> fits. If it had given Mr. <span class="smcap">Barton M</span>c<span class="smcap">Guckin</span>
fits&mdash;a pair of them&mdash;my previous allusion to the tailor would
have lacked a tangible basis of fact. Fancy <i>Carmen</i> frightened by an
ordinary horse, not even a dray-horse, of which no Carmen would have
been afraid!</p>

<h4>The Garden Scene from the Lane.</h4>
</div>

<p><i>Tuesday and Friday.&mdash;Faust.</i> Signor <span class="smcap">Runcio</span>, as <i>Faust</i>, up to the mark.
Military band of soldiers returned from the wars had apparently
conquered the drum of a British regiment. Signor <span class="smcap">Abramoff</span> (good as
<i>Mephistopheles</i>) showed his generous disposition by sharing his red
light with <i>Martha</i> when he was talking to her.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday.&mdash;Romeo and Juliet</i>, repetition of last week when the season
commenced with <span class="smcap">Gonoud's</span> masterpiece. Scenery tested the resources of
some of the greatest Drury Lane successes. The pantomime in the
ball-room was particularly excellent and noticeable.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.&mdash;Mignon</i>, represented by charming Miss <span class="smcap">Moody</span>. Supported by
the dullest of <i>Lotharios</i>, Mr. <span class="smcap">F. H. Celli</span>. <i>Wilhelm</i> played by a very
small tenor&mdash;in fact one who looked like a <span class="smcap">Child</span>. The cast good all
round, and a crowded house enthusiastic. One of the best revivals of the
season.</p>

<p><i>Saturday.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Wallace's</span> <i>Lurline</i> in the evening, after <i>Carmen</i> in the
morning. "Troubador" just as enchanting as he was twenty years ago. "The
silver river," too, "flows on" as sweetly as ever. Good house testifies
to the love we all have for home-made music. On the whole a satisfactory
week from every point of view. So far&mdash;all's well.</p>

<h2>"A SOCIETY FOR THE STUDY OF INEBRIETY."</h2>

<center>(<i>Notes by Mr. Punch's Own Reporter.</i>)</center>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 30%">
<a href="images/181b.png">
<img src="images/181b.png" width="100%" alt="cartoon" /></a>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the last occasion of the Meeting of the above Society a most
interesting paper was read by Professor <span class="smcap">James Jambes</span>, F.R.Z.S.,
describing a series of experiments to which, in the cause of Science, he
had recently submitted himself. Commencing by comparatively small
quantities of alcoholic stimulant, he gradually increased the doses
until he reached a maximum of three bottles of Brandy and one of Green
Chartreuse <i>per diem</i>, abandoning all other work during the period
embraced by the experiments. After a fortnight of patient research he
was rewarded by the discovery in his immediate neighbourhood of an
abundance of blackbeetles, which he was unable to refer to any known
species of <i>Orthoptera</i>. These were succeeded by reptiles and beasts of
various kinds and colours, specimens of which, owing to their
evasiveness, he much regretted to have been unsuccessful in securing.
After increasing the dose to two bottles daily, he was able to detect
the presence of rodents in large quantities. Subsequently these
creatures assumed the most surprising shapes, while their colouring was
frequently gorgeous in the extreme. He had made some brandy-and-water
sketches of the most remarkable&mdash;though he had to apologise for the
drawing being less accurate and clear than he could have wished, as the
conditions were generally unfavourable for scientific observation.
Still, they afforded a very fair idea of the principal phenomena which
he had met. (<i>Cheers.</i>) The Professor, in concluding, remarked that he
himself had never been a Materialist, and that, after the experiences
that attended the addition of the third bottle of brandy and the Green
Chartreuse to his diurnal allowance, he could only confess that, in the
words of the Poet, there were more&mdash;many more&mdash;things in heaven and
earth than had been dreamed of in <i>his</i> philosophy. Some of the imps,
for instance, that he had noticed on the foot of his bed, he should
never forget. He must ask indulgence for any short-comings both in the
manner and matter of his contribution, on the ground that he was still
suffering from severe indisposition, in consequence of the ardour with
which his researches had been pursued. He felt that he was still only on
the threshold, but he was fascinated by the glimpses he had already
obtained of the strange and wonderful things with which the study of
Advanced Inebriety would make the humblest of us increasingly familiar.
(<i>Great cheering.</i>)</p>

<p>The reading of the paper was followed by a discussion, in which Dr.
<span class="smcap">Loschen</span> said, that he was in a position from his own experience to
corroborate most of the statements in the very interesting account to
which they had just listened. He thought the learned Professor had, if
anything, rather underrated the dimensions of some of the snakes. He
could see a particularly fine specimen at that moment under the
Chairman's table, and would postpone any further remarks he was about to
make.</p>

<p>Professor <span class="smcap">Squiffie</span> said he had not as yet brought his experiments so far
as the last speakers. He was not a Naturalist himself. His line was
Optics. He described some interesting cases of Double Refraction, Mock
Suns, and Lunar Rainbows, that had come under his notice, before sitting
down with some suddenness on the floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Staggers</span>, F.H.S., R.C.V.S., said that most of his time had been
devoted to the study of Seismatics. It was a fact not generally known
that "earth tremors" were of almost nightly occurrence after eleven <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>
Some persons refused to believe that the world went round the sun, but
he had seen it do so several times in the course of a single minute.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Orrers</span> wished to know whether any member present had formed any
theory respecting the fantastic attire, particularly in the matter of
head-dresses, affected by the <i>fauna</i> encountered in the more advanced
stages of Inebriety. Why, for example, should kangaroos, especially in
Piccadilly, present themselves in the bonnets usually worn by Salvation
lasses? And again, what natural affinity was there between the common
rabbit and a fez cap? He asked the question because it had been upon his
mind a good deal of late.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 20%">
<a href="images/181c.png">
<img src="images/181c.png" width="100%" alt="cartoon" /></a>
</div>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">D. T. Jumper</span> said he merely desired to make one remark with regard
to the pink rhinoceros, which Professor <span class="smcap">James</span>&mdash;or, if he might take the
liberty of so describing him, "dear old <span class="smcap">Jem Jambes</span>"&mdash;had mentioned as
having found in his bath. Speaking personally, he had never come across
the pink variety of these interesting pachyderms. He had seen them
green, or striped,&mdash;but not pink. Was it not just possible that his
distinguished and excellent friend had been misled by some deficiency in
his eyesight or the light on this occasion? With regard to imps, both
blue and spotted, he could only say&mdash;&mdash;but he was compelled to stop
here, as he had barely time to catch the last train to his Retreat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Booser</span> said he wasn't scientific fler, like some other flers, still
he flattered himself he was fler that knew as much about Inebriety as
most flers, and if there was any fler there liked doubt his word, give
him the lie&mdash;they understood what give him the lie meant&mdash;he
repeated&mdash;give him the lie, why, what he wanted to know was, why didn't
they have courage of their opinions? They knew where find him, and if
they didn't&mdash;<i>he</i> knew where find them. (<i>Uproar.</i>)</p>

<p>The Meeting then broke up in some confusion, as the Chairman, having
removed his boots during the proceedings, was unable to propose the
customary vote of thanks to Professor <span class="smcap">Jambes</span>, who left the hall in a
state of considerable excitement in consequence.</p>

<hr />

<p>The Art Kaleidoscope may undoubtedly be found at 160, New Bond Street,
where the Messrs. <span class="smcap">Dowdeswells</span> are everlastingly giving it a turn. Before
you have time to get tired of one show, the turn is made, and another
reigns in its place. Yesterday it was Royal Berkshire, to-day it is
pictures principally of the French School. There are some fine works by
<span class="smcap">Corot</span>, which, however, did not justify a weak-minded critic in calling
the show "the Corotid Art-ery." Also examples of <span class="smcap">Monticelli</span>, <span class="smcap">Segantini</span>
the Italian, <span class="smcap">Daubigny</span>, <span class="smcap">Troyon</span>, <span class="smcap">Muhrman</span>, and other notable painters.</p>

<h2>FIRST APPEARANCE OF THE SWISS-BACK RAILWAY.</h2>

<center>(<i>By Our Easter Eggsperimentalist.</i>)</center>

<p>I have no hesitation in asserting that Lynton and Lynmouth are
frequently called the English Switzerland. I have seen such an
announcement made in the local Guide-books, and heard the opinion
adopted by many of the inhabitants. I am inclined to think that the name
is not a misnomer, for certainly the twin villages, with their miniature
manor-houses and cottage-like country-seats, are not unsuggestive of a
German box of toys. But there is very little of the foreigner in the
inhabitants. Rarely have I seen so much enthusiasm exhibited as on the
occasion of the opening of the Cliff Railway, an event which came off on
Easter Monday. The conveyance in question was suggestive of the
Switchback, or perhaps of the Swissback, when local surroundings are
taken into consideration. The inaugural programme was a long one. We had
a procession, with some eccentric mummers garbed as "Ancient Foresters,"
an opening ceremony, with a Royal salute, fired by three Coastguardsmen,
a banquet at the Valley of Rocks Hotel, life-boat exercise, and,
finally, a grand display of fireworks. I took part in every function. I
applauded the Ancient Foresters, in white beards and brown heads of
hair. I was the earliest to use the railway. I made a speech at the
banquet, I helped to man the life-boat, and, finally, I was the first to
cry "O-o-o-o-o-h!" at the initial rocket of the grand display. So I
think I may be allowed to say that I know something about the place and
its inhabitants. <i>Imprimis</i>, Lynton has an excellent hotel, in the shape
of the one to which I have already referred. Secondly, it has a great
benefactor in the person of worthy Mr. <span class="smcap">Newnes</span>, M. P., the genial and
clever Chairman of the Cliff Railway Company. Thirdly, the loveliness of
the scenery is greatly enhanced by the fact that practically there are
no residents (probably not half a dozen) in the neighbourhood. It is
true that there is a villa here and there, but none of them is large
enough in itself to spoil the effect of the rocks, the cascades, and the
mountain passes. I admit that when I went to Lynton I was under the
impression that I was going to take part in the inauguration of some
score miles of railway, opening out a new route to the Far West. That
this was an erroneous idea was more my fault than my misfortune. After
trying on foot an ascent from Lynmouth to Lynton, I came to the
conclusion that this line of railway was of far greater importance than
any other in existence. That the track was rather less than a thousand
feet, instead of being rather more than a million miles, I considered
merely a matter of detail. Should it be necessary some day to dispense
with the coach-journey from Barnstaple to Lynton&mdash;a journey which, on
account of the exercise in which the travellers are encouraged to
indulge on foot, must be of the greatest possible benefit to their
health&mdash;why then the railway could be extended from point to point. All
that would be required would be proportionately computed additional
capital. The formula would run as follows:&mdash;If 900 feet of railway from
Lynmouth to Lynton costs so much, 18 miles of railway from Lynton to
Barnstaple will cost so much more. The simplest thing in the world! And
with this practical suggestion for the future I conclude my report, with
the observation that the twin villages of Lynton and Lynmouth deserve
the greatest possible prosperity. Nature, represented by "Ragged Jack,"
the "Devil's Cheese Wring," and Watersmeet, is lovely beyond compare;
and Art could have no better illustration than that furnished by the
unsurpassed resources of the Valley of Rocks Hotel.</p>

<p>"It's going to rain to-morrow," said Mrs. R., confidently&mdash;"I am sure of

<h2>"IN THE KNOW."</h2>

<center>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Prophet.</i>)</center>

<p>The collapse of <i>Gasbag</i> can have surprised no careful reader of these
columns. His public performances have been uniformly wretched, save and
except on the one occasion when he defeated <i>Ranunculus</i> in the
Decennial Pedigree Stakes at Newmarket last year, and any fool could
have seen that <i>Ranunculus</i> had an off hind fetlock as big as an
elephant's. That comes of training a good horse on Seidlitz powders and
bran-mash. The muddy-minded moon-calves who chatter in their usual
addle-pated fashion about the chances of <i>Jimjams</i>, ought to deceive
nobody now that their insane folly has been exposed by me for about the
thousandth time; but the general public is such a blathering
dunderheaded ass that it prefers to trust itself to the guidance of men
like Mr. <span class="smcap">Jeremy</span>, who knows as much about a horse as he does about the

<h2>ROOKY WALKER!</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;Perhaps you have read the stories now being told in the
<i>Spectator</i> about rooks and wasps as Policemen. "W.H.W.H." says that a
pair of rooks were persecuted while building their nest, and that a big
rook was deputed to guard them from attack&mdash;which he did, like other
policemen, by employing the "beak." There is really nothing at all
remarkable about this tale. Rooks are much more wonderful creatures than
anybody knows about. In my own garden, for instance, there is a rook who
acts as chaplain to a whole rookery. He might almost be called a "bird
of pray." Every Saturday he assembles all the rooks on one large tree,
and caws solemnly to them for ten minutes. I have noticed (through an
opera-glass) that the congregation wears a very devout appearance.
Churchwarden rooks go round while the service is proceeding, and peck
any birds that seem inattentive. At the close there is a universal caw,
which I believe stands for "Amen." It is a curious fact that the
chaplain rook on these occasions always ornaments himself with a wisp of
white grass tied round his neck, which increases his clerical aspect. I
have tried to induce the rooks&mdash;by firing at them with small shot&mdash;to
adopt Sunday instead of Saturday as their day of devotions, but hitherto
without success. You may think the above worth publishing. It is quite
true.</p>

<p class="regards">Yours, &amp;c.,</p>
<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Longbow.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;Here is a fact which beats "W.H.W.H.'s" rook story hollow. Rooks
are keen politicians. I once saw an assembly of them&mdash;I don't know if it
was the local Caw-cus or not&mdash;divide into two portions, one going to one
tree, another to another, and then two elderly rooks went round, and
counted both batches. After the counting was over they returned from the
lobbies, and business proceeded as before. I have seen the closure very
effectually put on a talkative rook.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I can confirm these tales of animal Policemen in every
particular&mdash;indeed, I am able to add to them. I have often seen a couple
of tom-tits, on leaving their nests for an outing, put a tom-tit
constable on guard till they came back. But here is a still more
remarkable circumstance. On one occasion several other tom-tits wanted
to rob this deserted nest, and they actually came up to the constable
and put something in his claw, after which he looked the other way while
they were rifling the nest. <i>They had bribed him!</i> Comment is
superfluous.</p>

<h2>L'ABB&Eacute; INCONSTANTIN PARSONIFIED.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> first impression of <i>A Village Priest</i> is that, in one respect, Mr.
<span class="smcap">Grundy</span> has done well to choose the historical name of the execrable
"Abb&eacute; <span class="smcap">Dubois</span>," and bestow it on the <i>Cur&eacute;</i>, who is meant to be the
interesting hero of what, without him, would have been a sufficiently
strong melodrama. The very A B C of the practice of the confessional
being that everything between Priest and Penitent (even when the
Penitent is impenitent) is <i>sub sigillo</i>, this Abb&eacute; can have, as the
Grand Inquisitor in the <i>Gondoliers</i> sings, "No possible probable shadow
of doubt, No possible doubt whatever," as to his plain duty; and yet he
demands of Heaven a miracle to show him how <i>not</i> to do it. And to this
pious request comes an answer (by limelight) which demonstrates once
more how the Devil can quote Scripture to his purpose.</p>

<img src="images/185a.png" width="100%" alt="The Tree at the Haymarket" /></a>
<h3>The Tree at the Haymarket.</h3>
</div>

<p>Frankly, Mr. <span class="smcap">Grundy</span> has written three Acts of a play which must have
been powerful had he not extended it to five, and, had he not attempted
to centre the interest on a character which, charming as an incidental
sketch, is, as an essential, an excrescence. Practically the play is at
an end with the finish of the Third Act. Why lug in the <i>Abb&eacute;
Constantin</i>? And what an Abb&eacute;!!</p>

<p>Where are the familiar details? Where the ancient snuffbox, where his
snuffy old pocket-handkerchief? And where the old well-thumbed breviary
from which he is inseparable? <span class="smcap">M. Lafontaine</span> as the <i>Abb&eacute; Constantin</i>,
<i>the</i> man to the life, was never without the "old black book," under his
arm. The Haymarket Abb&eacute; takes his meals without blessing himself, by way
of saying grace, and fumbles about the heads of people who ask his
benison, like an awkward phrenologist feeling for bumps. And what kind
of an Abb&eacute; would he be who would tell a young girl that, "when she comes
to be as old as he is, she will have learnt to doubt everything?" Is it
characteristic of a French Abb&eacute; to complain of his housekeeper "lighting
his fire with his sermons?" It would be quite in keeping with the type
of an English Clergyman, who, as a rule, preaches from a written sermon;
but not of a French Priest, who preaches without book or manuscript. No;
the <i>Abb&eacute; Dubois</i> is the <i>Abb&eacute; Constantin</i> spoilt, a French <i>Cur&eacute;</i>
Anglicised into a pet Ritualistic Clergyman, <span class="smcap">Robert-Elsmere</span>'d-all-over
by Mr. <span class="smcap">Grundy</span>, and finally im-parson-ated by Mr. <span class="smcap">Beerbohm Tree</span>. Wasn't
it Mr. <span class="smcap">Beerbohm Tree</span> who, years ago, created the original of the
Bath-bun-eating comical Curate, in <i>The Private Secretary</i>? Well, this
is the same comical Clergyman grown older, and with the burden on, what
he is pleased to call, his mind of a dying scoundrel's last speech and
confession. The strongest objection he has to violate his sacred trust
arises from the fear that such a revelation would break the heart of an
exemplary old Goody Two-Shoes, for whom he has all his life long
cherished a youthful love, the thought of which, and not his
supernatural vocation, has sustained him, so I understood him to say,
throughout his priestly career. All very pretty and "pale young
Curatey," and theatrically sentimental, but don't put this man forward
as the self-sacrificing hero of a Melodrama. No; the subject is best let
alone. Mr. <span class="smcap">Grundy</span> seems to have rushed in where wiser men have feared to
tread, and thoroughly to have "put his foot in it," all for the sake of
transplanting <i>L'Abb&eacute; Constantin</i>, whom he has transformed into <i>L'Abb&eacute;
In-Constantin</i>.</p>

<p>The piece is beautifully put on the stage, and accepting the story as
worked out by Mr. <span class="smcap">Grundy's</span> characters, the acting is excellent all
round. There are two powerful situations, one in the First Act between
the Judge's son, Mr. <span class="smcap">Fred Terry</span>, and the innocent victim, Mr. <span class="smcap">Fernandez</span>,
admirably played; and another in the Second between Mr. <span class="smcap">Terry</span> and Miss
<span class="smcap">Leclercq</span>, also rendered with considerable power. Little Miss <span class="smcap">Norrey's</span>
shrill squeak, or scream, or whatever it is, at the end of the First
Act, imperils the situation, and might be toned down with advantage, as
also might her spasmodic melodramatic acting later in the piece. Mrs.
<span class="smcap">Tree's</span> is a pretty part, but not a strong one. To sum up, apart from the
two situations I have cited, I should say, that what will linger in the
memory of man when it runneth not to the contrary, is not the false
sentiment, but the real water which fills the real watering-pot, the
blossoming apple-tree, and, above all, the stolidly-chivalrous Mr. <span class="smcap">Allen</span>
as <i>Captain of Gendarmes</i>. By the way, the exterior of the presbytery is
that of a small cottage. Excellent. The interior, representing the
Abb&eacute;'s sitting-room, is a large and lofty Gothic cell&mdash;a regular
cell&mdash;capable of holding two such presbyteries as we have just seen from
outside. But there&mdash;it is another lesson&mdash;never judge by appearances.</p>

<p> Probable future of the ex-Abb&eacute; In-Constantin. He marries
Madame D'Arcay, and they come over to England and join the Salvation
Army.</p>
</div>

<p>To return for the last time to the <i>dramatis person&aelig;</i>, everyone who sees
this play will regret that the Author has not bestowed as much pains on
the character of the <i>Captain of Gendarmes</i> as he has on the maudlin
water-pottering old <i>Cur&eacute;</i>. The drama, after the Third Act, is
lugubrious. Why not lighten the general depression by bringing on the
<i>Captain of Gendarmes</i> to the "<i>Boulanger March</i>," and making him as
amusing as <i>Sergeant Lupin</i> in <i>Robert Macaire</i>? The piece is well
mounted, why should not the Gendarmes be also mounted? There are four or
six of them. What an effect has been missed by not bringing them in on
real horses, and giving them a quartette or a sestette <i>&agrave; cheval</i>, with
a solo for the Captain! Then the Captain might know all about the
murder, and <i>he</i> would reveal it without breaking the seal&mdash;unless it
were to crack a bottle&mdash;and all would end happily. As it is, all ends
miserably, or would so end, but for the Captain, whose last words before
the fall of the Curtain, uttered in his best French, are "<i>Ong Avong!
Marsh!</i>" From which it may be inferred that they are going into a dismal
swamp, but it is magnificent, if not <i>la guerre</i>, and this cry of the
Captain has a true military ring about it that gladdens the heart of</p>

<p>In <i>The Splendid Spur</i>, "Q." has given his Pegasus his head&mdash;(Queer

must mind my P's and Q's)&mdash;and has spared neither whip nor splendid spur
in his wild ride. Up behind, and clinging to "Q.," we are carried
onward, amid clashing of arms, booming of cannon, pealing of bells,

recommends it as a stirring work for the novel-skipper in an idle hour.</p>

<p>By the way, it would be difficult, to say the least of it, to prove that
the slang phrase "shut up" and the Americanism "say" were never used in
<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1642, in the sense in which they are used in 1890, but they are
scarcely characteristic of the modes of expression at that particular
period.</p>

<h2>THOUGHTS ON HIS WINE-MERCHANT.</h2>

<div class="poem1"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">I love my Wine-merchant&mdash;he talks with a charm</p>
<p class="i0">That robs his most dubious vintage of harm.</p>
<p class="i0">And the choicest Havanas less comforting are</p>
<p class="i0">Than the fumes of his special commended cigar.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">I'm a reticent man, with a palate of wood,</p>
<p class="i0">And I judge by results if a vintage be good.</p>
<p class="i0">But I own to the charm of my Wine-merchant's worst,</p>
<p class="i0">If he gives me his comforting flattery first.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">He proffers me samples to praise or to blame,</p>
<p class="i0">And I strongly suspect they're exactly the same.</p>
<p class="i0">But we gaze at each other with critical eye,</p>
<p class="i0">And I wish he would hint if it's fruity or dry.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">I want, say, a dozen of average stuff</p>
<p class="i0">(Though a couple of bottles were really enough),</p>
<p class="i0">And I enter his portals, reluctant and slow,</p>
<p class="i0">Resolved just to give him the order and go.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">But he takes me in hand in his soothering style,</p>
<p class="i0">Suggests in a whisper, and "books" with a smile;</p>
<p class="i0">And I vainly dissemble the joy in my face</p>
<p class="i0">When he ceases to ply me with bottle and case.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">The talk drifts away to affairs of the State,</p>
<p class="i0">And I ought to escape, but I palter and wait;</p>
<p class="i0">And he opens a box in the midst of his chat,</p>
<p class="i0">And asks, like a flash, my opinion of "that"?</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">I sniff the tobacco, and turn it about</p>
<p class="i0">With an air that is really of genuine doubt,</p>
<p class="i0">And knowing so little what judges would say,</p>
<p class="i0">I meekly consent to a hundred&mdash;and pay.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">There's a charm, when the varied consignment arrives,</p>
<p class="i0">To men who are blest with amenable wives;</p>
<p class="i0">But I watch my <span class="smcap">Amanda</span> with covert alarm,</p>
<p class="i0">And wait till she severs the Wine-merchant's charm.</p>

<h2>MODERN TYPES.</h2>

No. IX.&mdash;THE ADVERTISING BARRISTER.</center>

<div class="figright" style="width: 30%">
<a href="images/192a.png">
<img src="images/192a.png" width="100%" alt="BARRISTER" /></a>
</div>

<p>The Advertising Barrister may best be defined as the living and pushing
embodiment of self-assertion and impudence. He is not of those who by a
life of steady and honourable toil attain eventually to the high places
of their profession, whether at the Bar or in Parliament, without losing
the respect and friendship of their fellows. These too in the race of
life must pass many of the feebler runners, and force themselves by
their own merit into places that others would fain have occupied, but
they always run straight, their practice and their performance are
disfigured by no trick, and in the end they bring their honour
untarnished to the goal, and receive the applause even of their
vanquished rivals. With them the Advertising Barrister has no point in
common, save the robes he wears in virtue of his call. For his ambition
is as sordid as the means whereby he attempts to fulfil it are
questionable. He must be credited with the knowledge that his natural
abilities are by themselves insufficient to assure him either fame or
wealth. But he consoles himself by reflecting that if only impudence,
<i>r&eacute;clame</i>, and a taste for the arts of a cadger, be protected by the
hide of a rhinoceros, they are certain to prevail up to a certain point
against the humdrum industry of those inferior beings who hamper
themselves with considerations of honour and good-feeling. It must not
be understood that the Advertiser puffs himself in a literal sense in
the advertising columns of the press. The rules of his profession, to
which even he pays an open deference, forbid this enormity; but in the
subtler methods of gaining a certain attention, and of keeping his name
under the public eye, he has no equal even in the ranks of those who
spend thousands in order that the million may be made happy with soap.</p>

<p>The boyhood and youth of the Advertising Barrister will have been passed
in comparative obscurity. The merchant who relieved the monotony of a
large and profitable wholesale business by treating him as a son,
impressed upon him at an early age the necessity of making the family
history illustrious by soaring beyond commerce to professional
distinction and a fixed income. In furtherance of this scheme the son
was sent to pick up a precarious education at a neighbouring day-school,
where he astonished his companions by his ease in mastering the polite
literature of the ancients and the vulgar fractions of Mr. <span class="smcap">Barnard
Smith</span>, and delighted his masters by the zeal with which he generally
took his stand on the side of authority. Having, however, in the course
of a school examination been detected in the illicit use of a volume of
Bohn's Library, he was called upon for an explanation, and, after
failing to satisfy his examiners that he meant only to reflect credit
upon the school by the accuracy of his translations, he was advised to
leave at the end of the term. After a short interval spent in the
society of a coach, he entered a fast College at one of our ancient
Universities, and, being possessed of a fairly comfortable allowance,
soon distinguished himself by the calculating ardour with which he
affected the acquaintance of young men of rank, and shared in the
fashionable pleasures of the place. Recognising that amidst the careless
and easy-going generosity of undergraduate society, he who has a cool
and scheming head is usually able to tip the balance of good luck in his
own favour, he lost no opportunity of ingratiating himself with those
who might be of service to him. He cultivated a fluent style of
platitudes and claptrap at his college debating society, and at the
Union, to the committee of which he was elected after prolonged and
assiduous canvassing. Having managed to be proctorised in company with
the eldest son of a peer, whom he delighted by the studied impertinence
of his answers to the Proctor, he eventually went down with a pass
degree and a mixed reputation, and, after the orthodox number of
dinners, and the regulation examination, had the satisfaction of seeing
his name published in the list of those who, having acquired a
smattering of Roman and English law, were entitled, for a consideration,
to aid litigants with their counsel.</p>

<p>For the next few years little was heard of him. He read in chambers,
drew pleadings and indictments, and gathered many useful tricks from the
criminal advocate to whom he attached himself like a leech. During this
period he also made the acquaintance of a Solicitor who had retired from
the noon-day glare of professional rectitude to the congenial atmosphere
of shady cases. He also struck up a friendship with two or three
struggling journalists, who were occupied in hanging on to the
paragraphic fringe of their profession, and who might be trusted
afterwards to lend a hand to an intimate engaged in a similar, but not
identical line of business. Helped by a shrewd, and not over-scrupulous
clerk, he gradually picked up a practice, a thing mainly of shreds and
patches, but still a practice of a sort. At the Middlesex Sessions, and
at the Central Criminal Court, his name began to be mentioned; and in a
certain money-lending case it was acknowledged that his astuteness had
prevented the exposure of his client from being as crushing and complete
as the rate of per-centage had seemed to warrant.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards, one of his richer college companions, whose convictions
were stronger than his power of expressing them, was selected as
Candidate for a remote constituency, where speakers were not easily
obtained. The glib Barrister was remembered, and appealed to. At an
immense sacrifice of time and money, he rushed to the rescue, his
travelling and hotel expenses being defrayed by the Candidate. He spoke
much, he spoke triumphantly; he referred, in touching terms, to the ties
of ancient friendship that bound him to the noblest and best of men, the
Candidate; and, when the latter was eventually elected, it was stated in
every Metropolitan evening paper that he owed his success chiefly to the
eloquence and energy of the able Barrister who had pleaded his cause.
Henceforward there was no peace, politically speaking, for the
Barrister. Swifter than swift <span class="smcap">Camilla</span> he scoured the plain facts of
political controversy at meeting after meeting, until they glowed under
the dazzled eyes of innumerable electors. Where Leagues congregated, or
Unions met, or Associations resolved, there he was to be found, always
eager, in the fore-front of the battle. He became the cheap jackal of
the large political lions who roar after their food throughout the
length and breadth of the land, and picked up scraps in the shape of
votes of thanks to chairmen. He figured at political receptions, and
eventually contested a hopeless Constituency, with the assistance of the
party funds. Having, by his complete defeat, established a claim on the
gratitude of his party, he applied successively for a Recordership, a
Police Magistracy, and a County Court Judgeship, but was compelled to be
satisfied temporarily with the post of Revising Barrister. Yet, though
he was disgusted with the base ingratitude of time-serving politicians,
he was by no means disheartened, for he had long since become convinced
that the best method of self-seeking was to seek office, and to clamour
if that should be refused. Finally, after having paid to have his
portrait engraved in a struggling party journal, and having appended to
it a description, in which he compared himself to <span class="smcap">Erskine</span> and the
younger <span class="smcap">Pitt</span>, he became an annoyance to those who were his leaders at
the Bar, or in politics. He was, therefore, appointed Chief Justice of
the Soudan; and after distributing British justice to savages, at a
cheap rate, for several years, he retired upon a pension, and was heard
of no more.</p>

<h2>ROBERT'S LITTLE HOLLERDAY.</h2>

<p>Easter Munday I dewoted to Epping Forrest. I draws a whale over my
feelings when I looked out of my bed-room winder and seed the rain a
cumming down in bucket-fulls! But a true Waiter can allus afford to
Wait.</p>

<div class="poem1"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"Late as you likes, but never hurly,</p>
<p class="i0">Seldom cross, and never surly,</p>
<p class="i0">The jowial Waiter gos to his work,</p>
<p class="i0">And enwys no Hethun nor yet no Turk!"</p>
</div></div>

<p>And I had my reward, for at 12.20 A.M. the jolly old sun bust forth, as
much as to say, "it was only my fun!" So off I started by Rail, along
with about a thowsand others, in such a jolly, rattling Nor-Wester, that
the River Lea looked more like a arm of the foming Hocean than a mere
tuppenny riwer. But the sun was nice and warm till about 1.30, when,
just for a change, I suppose, down came a nice little shower of snow!
and then more warm sun, and then plenty more cold wind, and then lots of
rain. So them as likes wariety had plenty of it that day. And what a
lovely wision was Epping Forest when we all got there! Ewerything as
coud assist in emusing, and eddicating, and refining about a hundred
thowsand peeple was there in such abundans that I myself heard a
properioter of no less than 6 lofty swings a complaining, in werry
powerful langwidge, that things in the swinging line are not as they
used to be three or four years ago, for lots of the peeple are such
fools that they acshally prefers taking a quiet walk through the Forest,
to being either swung, or roundabouted, or cokernutted, or ewen
Aunt-Salleyed! But the wise Filosopher will probbably say, if you wants
to make peeple happy, speshally them as don't werry often get the
chance, give 'em not what you likes, but what <i>they</i> likes, and leave it
to Old Father Time to teach 'em better sum day. <span class="smcap">Robert.</span></p>
